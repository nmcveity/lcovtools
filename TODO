TODO
  - Tidy up the code base, both C++ source and Python scripts
  - lcovtools.dump() prints the output XML to stdout, it should support an optional file parameter
  - Output report expects xsl in the same directory as the report, this should be configurable (same with lua.css)
  - An example cruise control script should be included
  - Reports should have a summary page, and then links to a page per input file (instead of the one giant page)
  - A few different CSS stylesheets should be provided
  - Need a clean.bat file that removes any files that shouldn't be distributed (objs, ilk, example outputs, etc...)
  - Needs FILES file to explain the purpose of the scripts
  - Need README file to explain the process
  - Clean up lua.css, possibly have two styles per keyword, one for normal, another for an invalid line?
  - XML generated by syntax highlighting is large:
       - examine ways to compress it (smaller class names? collapse spans with the same class?)
  - should be able to limit the number of revisions in the charts
